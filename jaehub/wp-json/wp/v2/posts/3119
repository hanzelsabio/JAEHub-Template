Your logistics partner will be responsible for storing your products and delivering them to your customers, so you must take the time to find the right one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a trustworthy logistics company in the Philippines is not easy, but it is possible. Here\u2019s a list of questions you should consider answering before choosing a logistics partner for your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Do they have credibility?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of logistics companies in the Philippines, and when you\u2019re looking for one, the first thing you have to check is their credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do this by doing some research on the different logistics companies. Know their track record and their reputation in the market. Check out their websites, social media accounts, and what their clients say about their services. Feedback matters, and you\u2019ll know if they are credible based on the service they provide their clients, as well as the reputation they\u2019re able to build through time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Do they have the right technology to do the work?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you need to consider in finding a logistics company in the Philippines is its technological capabilities. As the E-commerce industry evolves, so does logistics. With that said, the logistics company must integrate the latest IT systems for transport management, such as a courier algorithm that analyzes the best courier to manage your needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Are they offering transparent and competitive pricing?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Wasting money on bad logistics is a big no-no. To avoid falling into the trap of inconsistent and ambiguous pricing, check their rate card to know if their services are best suited for you. Also, a detailed report of delivery costs can help you choose your delivery schemes consciously and save you from wasting money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Do they have policies on returns and refunds?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While damaged and lost parcels can be inevitable, it still pays to have your back covered by knowing your logistics company\u2019s policies on refunds and returns. Checking if they have a safe delivery guarantee and transit damage policy can help you select the best logistics partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Will you get timely logistics updates?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication is crucial in customer management. The E-commerce industry has come to a point where almost all customers expect to know where their packages are at all times. Complaints about not getting real-time updates can create a dent in your reputation as an E-commerce business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Do they have 24\/7 customer support?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cases of lost parcels, mishandled packages, damaged goods, and unresponsive logistics partners have become prevalent, causing frustration for both merchants and customers. For customers especially, it can be discouraging when logistics companies cannot assist them promptly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a logistics provider that offers fast and consistent customer care service. You can actively observe this by checking how responsive they are in communications, and how they handle problems. It would be a plus if they offer 24\/7 customer support, or customer support through different channels.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Are they present in key locations?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make deliveries nationwide, you need to choose a logistics partner that can cover all parts of the country. It is important to note if they have multiple warehouses or if they are present in key locations in the Philippines, as this will benefit your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, you\u2019ll be able to reduce the usual delivery wait times because your products are closer to your customers. This also means that delivery costs won\u2019t be as expensive in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a reliable logistics company in the Philippines can be very challenging, but these questions will help you choose the right partner and strategically scale your business.
