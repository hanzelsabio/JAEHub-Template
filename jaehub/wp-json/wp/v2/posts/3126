It&#8217;s the process that covers a customer\u2019s entire order experience, starting from the moment they purchase an item until it reaches their home. If done well, this can leave a huge impression on customers and even inspire repeat purchases.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, order fulfillment can be overwhelming for new merchants especially if they\u2019re handling it in-house. This lack of experience can lead to failed deliveries that in turn, gives your store a bad reputation amongst customers and prevents you from growing your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be a successful E-commerce service in the Philippines, an understanding of the ins and outs of order fulfillment is a must.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, we\u2019re here to make this easier for you. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about order fulfillment before starting your own E-commerce service in the Philippines!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br>Storage <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, how you store your products plays a major role in the efficiency of your order fulfillment. Storing your products in areas near your customers can make it easier for you to deal with multiple orders. This can also help you cut down on costs and help you ship orders faster.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good way to simplify this process is by working with a warehousing service. Apart from the benefits mentioned above, they can even pick up your products from your location and store it in their warehouse for you. This ensures that the item is readily available for shipping once an order is placed.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Shipping and delivery<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon confirmation of an order, items are then picked from their storage area and packed for delivery.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New merchants usually directly coordinate with couriers about delivery. This is fine at first but once the orders start piling in, any E-commerce service in the Philippines looking to succeed needs to work with a logistics partner. Good partners have systems in place that tap multiple top couriers in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Last mile management\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The work doesn\u2019t stop when you hand over your package to a courier. A lot of issues can still take place while the package is in transit. Failed deliveries can happen due to miscoordination, couriers getting lost, customers not being able to receive items, and even wrong delivery details.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending to these matters takes time \u2013 time that you could be using to deal with other aspects of your business. It&#8217;s best to partner with a logistics provider that offers services like live customer support to prevent issues like this from happening. They\u2019ll take care of the coordination for you, and will ensure that your packages reach your customers without fail.<br><br>These are just some of the basics of order fulfillment that new merchants should know about before getting into E-commerce. It may seem difficult to execute without much experience, but with a logistics partner like Payo, that\u2019s not going to be a problem!\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/payo.asia\/\"><strong>Payo<\/strong><\/a>, is the Philippines\u2019 leading E-commerce enabler that can help merchants with <a href=\"https:\/\/payo.asia\/fulfillment-service-philippines\/\"><strong>Fulfillment<\/strong><\/a> and so much more!
