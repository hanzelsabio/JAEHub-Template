<p>In today’s time, a <a href="https://payo.asia/logistics-company-philippines/"><strong>logistics company in the Philippines</strong></a> needs to become agile to adapt to the changing landscape. Adopting trends, embracing digital, and innovating services – these are only some of the ways for one to remain competitive as a provider of logistics solutions.</p>



<p>For a company or merchant that’s looking for a partner, you may wonder what logistics is, its meaning, and its function. Here’s a quick read to help you better understand how everything works.</p>



<h4>Logistics and its meaning</h4>



<p>In business, the process of transporting, receiving and storing resources is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/logistics.asp">Logistics</a>. Its meaning was derived from how the military managed and transported different supplies and equipment. Now, it is used mainly by businesses and encompasses <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/logistics#:~:text=Logistics%20is%20the%20process%20of,timely%2C%20cost%2Deffective%20manner.">transportation and warehousing functions</a> – services provided by a logistics company in the Philippines.</p>



<p>Transportation refers to how products are delivered from their origin to their destination. This includes a vehicle plan, an itinerary, and a schedule to properly manage when and where goods will be picked up and dropped off.</p>



<p>Warehousing is all about inventory management and order fulfillment. Products are kept for storage in warehouses. As orders come in, products are taken from these warehouses, packed, and shipped to the recipient.</p>



<p>For goods that come from abroad, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/logistics#:~:text=Logistics%20is%20the%20process%20of,timely%2C%20cost%2Deffective%20manner.">customs management</a> becomes part of logistics. This encompasses transactions and the necessary documents needed to import or receive products through a country’s international ports.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Logistics in the Philippines</h4>



<p>Logistics in the Philippines has rapidly evolved in recent years, and most of it was driven by the pandemic. Prior to the widespread integration of technology, processes were more traditional and were also prone to various challenges.</p>



<p>According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.marketresearchphilippines.com/insight/The-Logistics-Industry-in-the-Philippines-Its-Challenges-and-Solution">research</a>, among these challenges were: Traffic congestion in Metro Manila which could potentially lead to daily losses of USD 106.4 million by 2023; Manual processes that result in longer lead times and unhappy customers; and, inefficient clearance processes with customs that also leads to port congestions.</p>



<p>These opened up various opportunities to help avoid any further losses to the logistics sector. The same research provided digital-centric solutions including working with tech-savvy experts, partnering with digital-capable companies, and digitizing operational aspects. A year later, the adoption of these measures became necessary with the sudden boom of E-commerce.</p>



<h4>Transformation of logistics</h4>



<p>Logistics and its meaning rapidly changed in the last two years. Filipinos started exploring the digital marketplace while businesses ventured into online retail. Both are now present in websites, online marketplaces, and on different social media platforms, giving birth to all-new shopping behaviors in the community.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/philippines-freight-and-logistics-market">Data</a> showed that the number of online sellers in the Philippines grew from 1,700 to more than 93,300 from March 2020 to January 2021. Annual revenues have also significantly increased from less than USD 99,000 in 2019 to over USD 170,000 in 2021. These numbers are only forecasted to grow even further in the years to come.</p>



<p>This change also saw the need for logistics companies in the Philippines to evolve and innovate. Apart from transportation and warehousing, companies now offer different digital solutions to help merchants and sellers grow digitally and service online customers.</p>



<p>Payo is an E-commerce enabler that makes for a perfect logistics partner for companies of different sizes.

<p>As the year comes to a close, merchants doing <a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-philippines/"><strong>E-commerce in the Philippines</strong></a> must remain on the lookout for what’s next. From ways to innovate operations to new offerings, there’s always merit in learning about top E-commerce trends, especially for 2023.</p>



<p>The fast-paced development of technology has opened up a lot of opportunities for businesses online. Now is every merchant’s chance to become an early adapter with this list of E-commerce trends in 2023.</p>



<h4>The rise of video shopping</h4>



<p>Photos will remain an essential part of the online shopping experience, but among the top E-commerce trends for 2023 is the use of videos. While Filipinos have learned and adapted to live selling, merchants can’t always host them. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/16/online-shopping-trends-to-watch-in-2023/?sh=201cff126ee7">Video shopping</a> is another way of showcasing products in detail. It offers a 360-view and a demonstration of how they work &#8211; similar to how TV shopping is done, only it’s on mobile and on social media.</p>



<h4>More variety in payment options</h4>



<p>Cash-on-Delivery has become an increasingly effective payment option for those doing E-commerce in the Philippines. As the financial landscape changes, many platforms are starting to offer other options including a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/11/16/online-shopping-trends-to-watch-in-2023/?sh=201cff126ee7">Buy-Now-Pay-Later scheme, and even loans</a>. These allow customers to purchase products and settle payments at a much later time, providing more flexibility.</p>



<h4>Chatbots for 24/7 service</h4>



<p>The world of E-commerce in the Philippines is becoming smaller and more on-demand. In reality, merchants can’t always be present or online to respond to inquiries. Thus, among the E-commerce trends expected in 2023 is the growth of <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/retails-trends/#4_Chatbots_are_the_newest_team_members">chatbot integration</a>. It offers a seamless shopping experience through automated responses, helping provide 24/7 service and allowing merchants to step in during more crucial or important concerns.</p>



<p>Over the years, the function of chatbots has evolved. Chatbots today are no longer simply offering automated responses. They’ve become the online personas of brands, complete with names and avatars, and can provide more complex answers to queries. In 2023, chatbots are forecasted to be capable of <a href="https://www.softwebsolutions.com/resources/chatbot-trends-2023.html">automating payments</a>, <a href="https://www.softwebsolutions.com/resources/chatbot-trends-2023.html">streamlining operations</a>, providing <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-chatbot-trends-and-predictions-to-know-in-2023/">consumer insights</a>, and many more tasks.</p>



<h4>Greener and more sustainable packaging</h4>



<p>The growth of E-commerce has also seen the spike in <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1502399/online-shopping-rise-brings-phenomenal-volume-of-plastic-wastes">use of plastic</a>, which poses potential threats to the environment. With society becoming more self-aware, many businesses are shifting to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/retails-trends/#9_Less_waste_in_packaging">greener and more sustainable options</a> in place of bubble wraps, packaging tapes, and other single-use plastics. Widespread use of these packing alternatives will also be one of the main E-commerce trends in 2023.</p>



<h4>Growth of voice shopping</h4>



<p>As the world becomes smarter and more digitally connected, different parts of the world saw an increase in the purchase of smart speakers. One of the more interesting E-commerce trends in 2023 is the growth of <a href="https://financesonline.com/ecommerce-trends/">voice shopping</a> through these devices. Merchants are encouraged to explore this trend to also cater to consumers who prefer this shopping method.</p>



<h4>Increased digital presence through omni-channel selling</h4>



<p>Nowadays, it may no longer be enough for a merchant to focus on one channel or platform alone. E-commerce in the Philippines is becoming more competitive as many learn the convenience and opportunities it offers. That said, one of the top E-commerce trends next year is<strong> <a href="https://financesonline.com/ecommerce-trends/">omnichannel selling</a></strong>. This means having a multi-channel presence to cater to more audiences on online marketplaces, social media, your website, and other platforms. </p>



<p>These E-commerce trends in 2023 can serve as a guide for merchants that want to try something new for their shop. These can help offer a new shopping experience for customers, while also maintaining competitiveness in the digital marketplace. But what would be most effective is partnering with an E-commerce enabler like Payo!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gone are the days when Facebook was just a multimedia entertainment platform. As E-commerce evolved, the social media site also became a place where people can connect in another way: through buying and selling.</p>



<p>When Facebook introduced an <a href="https://payo.asia/online-marketplace/"><strong>online marketplace</strong></a>, small businesses joined in to cater to their local communities. This marketplace on Facebook eventually morphed and became one of the fastest-growing online channels for merchants and customers to connect, especially at the onset of the pandemic. It is a convenient and accessible place for aspiring merchants to grow their businesses where they can tap millions of its users in just a click.</p>



<p>If you are thinking of joining it anytime soon, here are some of the basics you need to know to navigate this marketplace on Facebook.</p>



<h4>You can sell anything here!</h4>



<p>Well, almost. Since it is a free feature on Facebook, the marketplace allows merchants to sell almost anything from fashion items, home improvement supplies, toys, and games, to pet supplies, vehicles, and properties. Aside from new products, merchants can also sell pre-loved items. It&#8217;s kind of like a garage sale, but online.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>You can optimize your marketplace </h4>



<p>In this marketplace, you can simply create a new listing to sell something. A word of caution though &#8212; since a lot of merchants are already on Marketplace, it pays to stand out. So what can you do? Use quality photos for your listing, price your items competitively, and provide as many details as possible in the item description.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>You can target your listings based on location</h4>



<p>The online marketplace can help you sell different items on Facebook right off the bat. The platform welcomes any user with image tiles of items posted within their vicinity, so they can see the items that they need straight away. But if you want to make your listings targeted, you can adjust your location and radius to capture potential customers within your area. You can also choose from its categories to further help your customers narrow down their search.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>You can easily connect with your customer</h4>



<p>As a peer-to-peer platform, the marketplace on Facebook has devised a way to help you communicate easily with customers. All transactions in this online marketplace are started through Facebook Messenger—letting you connect with potential customers through a one-on-one conversation. Because it provides you with a real-time mode of communication, you can capitalize on their interest while it’s hot, helping prevent the customer from moving on and looking for other products.</p>



<h4>You can integrate other E-commerce platforms seamlessly</h4>



<p>As it is an online marketplace, merchants are given the liberty to integrate other E-commerce platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce with the Marketplace on Facebook. This enables merchants to leverage either platforms to expand their customer base and increase sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can pay for ads, acquire new consumers, set up a shop on Facebook to sell your products, and track the insights of customer actions when you choose to connect your marketplace store to your website.</p>



<h4>You can choose your mode of payment</h4>



<p>As the online marketplace does not facilitate payments or deliveries, merchants can choose payment modes for their stores. If you are an online seller in the Philippines, you’d know that cash is king and that customers would prefer Cash on Delivery. But with the growth of digital payments, some would offer online banks or mobile wallets like GCash, PayMaya, or Coins.ph to their customers.</p>



<h4>You can also choose a logistics partner</h4>



<p>In terms of delivering the items, you have the power to choose a reliable partner, or which method works best for you. Typically, marketplace sellers on Facebook would hand it over to the customer especially if they are within the vicinity. But to some, having a logistics partner is the best way to manage the deliveries. For one, it is more convenient. And secondly, it is easier to just have someone else deliver the items.</p>



<p>These are just some of the basic knowledge that you need to be equipped with when joining the marketplace on Facebook. With its massive audience and streamlined shopping experience, this online marketplace could be a fantastic addition to your E-commerce strategy in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re ready to start selling on online marketplaces, to level up your selling efforts, or just want a better handle on your strategy, Payo can be your reliable partner for it!</p>



<p>As an E-commerce enabler, Payo’s expertise can assist you in <a href="https://payo.asia/marketplace-optimization/"><strong>optimizing your marketplace</strong></a>, <a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-automation-philippines/"><strong>automating your processes</strong></a>, or even <a href="https://payo.asia/logistics-company-philippines/"><strong>managing your logistics</strong></a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Order fulfillment<strong> </strong>is the backbone of any <a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-services-philippines/"><strong>E-commerce service in the Philippines</strong></a>. It&#8217;s the process that covers a customer’s entire order experience, starting from the moment they purchase an item until it reaches their home. If done well, this can leave a huge impression on customers and even inspire repeat purchases. </p>



<p>However, order fulfillment can be overwhelming for new merchants especially if they’re handling it in-house. This lack of experience can lead to failed deliveries that in turn, gives your store a bad reputation amongst customers and prevents you from growing your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to be a successful E-commerce service in the Philippines, an understanding of the ins and outs of order fulfillment is a must.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, we’re here to make this easier for you. Here’s everything you need to know about order fulfillment before starting your own E-commerce service in the Philippines!&nbsp;</p>



<h4><br>Storage </h4>



<p>First off, how you store your products plays a major role in the efficiency of your order fulfillment. Storing your products in areas near your customers can make it easier for you to deal with multiple orders. This can also help you cut down on costs and help you ship orders faster.<br></p>



<p>A good way to simplify this process is by working with a warehousing service. Apart from the benefits mentioned above, they can even pick up your products from your location and store it in their warehouse for you. This ensures that the item is readily available for shipping once an order is placed.<br></p>



<h4>Shipping and delivery</h4>



<p>Upon confirmation of an order, items are then picked from their storage area and packed for delivery. </p>



<p>New merchants usually directly coordinate with couriers about delivery. This is fine at first but once the orders start piling in, any E-commerce service in the Philippines looking to succeed needs to work with a logistics partner. Good partners have systems in place that tap multiple top couriers in the country.</p>



<h4>Last mile management </h4>



<p>The work doesn’t stop when you hand over your package to a courier. A lot of issues can still take place while the package is in transit. Failed deliveries can happen due to miscoordination, couriers getting lost, customers not being able to receive items, and even wrong delivery details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attending to these matters takes time – time that you could be using to deal with other aspects of your business. It&#8217;s best to partner with a logistics provider that offers services like live customer support to prevent issues like this from happening. They’ll take care of the coordination for you, and will ensure that your packages reach your customers without fail.<br><br>These are just some of the basics of order fulfillment that new merchants should know about before getting into E-commerce. It may seem difficult to execute without much experience, but with a logistics partner like Payo, that’s not going to be a problem! </p>

<p>For most merchants, a reliable <a href="https://payo.asia/logistics-company-philippines/"><strong>logistics company in the Philippines</strong></a> is essential for running a successful E-commerce business. Your logistics partner will be responsible for storing your products and delivering them to your customers, so you must take the time to find the right one.</p>



<p>Finding a trustworthy logistics company in the Philippines is not easy, but it is possible. Here’s a list of questions you should consider answering before choosing a logistics partner for your company.</p>



<h4>Do they have credibility?</h4>



<p>There are a lot of logistics companies in the Philippines, and when you’re looking for one, the first thing you have to check is their credibility.</p>



<p>You can do this by doing some research on the different logistics companies. Know their track record and their reputation in the market. Check out their websites, social media accounts, and what their clients say about their services. Feedback matters, and you’ll know if they are credible based on the service they provide their clients, as well as the reputation they’re able to build through time.</p>



<h4>Do they have the right technology to do the work?</h4>



<p>Another thing you need to consider in finding a logistics company in the Philippines is its technological capabilities. As the E-commerce industry evolves, so does logistics. With that said, the logistics company must integrate the latest IT systems for transport management, such as a courier algorithm that analyzes the best courier to manage your needs.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Are they offering transparent and competitive pricing?</h4>



<p>Wasting money on bad logistics is a big no-no. To avoid falling into the trap of inconsistent and ambiguous pricing, check their rate card to know if their services are best suited for you. Also, a detailed report of delivery costs can help you choose your delivery schemes consciously and save you from wasting money.</p>



<h4>Do they have policies on returns and refunds?</h4>



<p>While damaged and lost parcels can be inevitable, it still pays to have your back covered by knowing your logistics company’s policies on refunds and returns. Checking if they have a safe delivery guarantee and transit damage policy can help you select the best logistics partner.</p>



<h4>Will you get timely logistics updates?</h4>



<p>Communication is crucial in customer management. The E-commerce industry has come to a point where almost all customers expect to know where their packages are at all times. Complaints about not getting real-time updates can create a dent in your reputation as an E-commerce business.</p>



<h4>Do they have 24/7 customer support?</h4>



<p>Cases of lost parcels, mishandled packages, damaged goods, and unresponsive logistics partners have become prevalent, causing frustration for both merchants and customers. For customers especially, it can be discouraging when logistics companies cannot assist them promptly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider a logistics provider that offers fast and consistent customer care service. You can actively observe this by checking how responsive they are in communications, and how they handle problems. It would be a plus if they offer 24/7 customer support, or customer support through different channels. </p>



<h4>Are they present in key locations?</h4>



<p>If you make deliveries nationwide, you need to choose a logistics partner that can cover all parts of the country. It is important to note if they have multiple warehouses or if they are present in key locations in the Philippines, as this will benefit your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For one, you’ll be able to reduce the usual delivery wait times because your products are closer to your customers. This also means that delivery costs won’t be as expensive in the long run.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-philippines/">E-commerce in the Philippines</a> </strong>has been gaining momentum as more Filipinos dive into the digital marketplace. With just a few simple clicks or taps, they see the opportunities that E-commerce offers for both consumers and businesses.</p>



<p>But before anything else, what is E-commerce exactly? How did it start in the Philippines and how can merchants get into it?</p>



<h4>Defining E-commerce</h4>



<p>E-commerce is <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/e-commerce">defined</a> as the buying and selling of goods and services through an electronic network, which is mainly powered by the Internet. Simply put, it’s similar to how goods and services are sold in brick and mortar stores only this time, it’s online.</p>



<p>Nowadays, E-commerce in the Philippines is more visible and is rapidly integrated into people’s way of living. Anyone has access to it because of how widespread it has become. These include social media, online marketplaces, digital stores via websites, and so much more.</p>



<p>Thanks to technology, E-commerce unlocks many opportunities, from putting up small businesses to creating savings for consumers. It ultimately makes for a vibrant and thriving E-commerce ecosystem in the Philippines.</p>



<h4>The growth of E-commerce</h4>



<p>Before Shopee and Lazada, the growth of online selling and online shopping in the Philippines was relatively slow. As Internet access became commercially available in the <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/29824-infographic-e-commerce-evolution-philippines/">early 80s</a>, banking institutions were the first ones doing electronic transactions. </p>



<p>The advancements in tech over the years opened up more ways to exchange goods and services. Brands started their own websites to sell products. Online selling platforms also emerged, which served as the foundation of E-commerce today. This included the likes of ebay, OLX (which many now know as <a href="https://blog.carousell.ph/about-carousell-philippines/olx-now-carousell/">Carousell</a>), and the late social media platform Multiply.</p>



<p>Despite these innovations, not all Filipinos were enticed at the time because they preferred cash transactions. These platforms mainly catered to credit and debit card holders, and those capable of digital banking and over-the-counter payments.</p>



<p>Over time, banking institutions started advocating for financial inclusivity to educate more Filipinos on the benefits of being banked. This soon started covering digital banking to help them find more ways and simpler options to do online transactions.</p>



<p>The surge in the popularity of E-commerce in the Philippines is the result of this evolution, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. The birth of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, e-wallets like GCash and Maya, and the introduction of Cash-on-Delivery as a payment option opened the doors for many Filipinos to embrace E-commerce.</p>



<h4>The E-commerce landscape today</h4>



<p>The rise of E-commerce in the Philippines certainly did not happen overnight. However, a lot of it can be credited to the pandemic-driven needs as it was a means for Filipinos to survive while in lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, E-commerce transactions are happening everywhere and are also seeping into newer platforms like Tiktok. Online retail is now driven by consumer presence, and is reinforced by the flexible payment methods. As for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/ph/research/future-of-commerce/future-of-ecommerce">the future</a>, the landscape will only grow further and the ecosystem will become more competitive on the digital front.</p>



<p>For startups and businesses, what is E-commerce offering now? A growing pool of opportunities! And having the right partner makes breaking into this market easier and less daunting, even on the operational side. With Payo, local and international merchants can do just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Filipinos are known for being especially enthusiastic about the Christmas season. This excitement even extends into the amount of effort they put into giving gifts for their loved ones.</p>



<p>As Filipinos start to tick off their gift lists, <a href="https://payo.asia/online-marketplace/"><strong>online marketplaces</strong></a> receive a rush of orders that greatly exceeds their usual sales. Shops that sell items already on customers&#8217; wish lists are usually the ones that profit the most. If you want to make the most out of this opportunity, then you should consider adding these kinds of items to your E-commerce store during the holiday season. </p>



<p>Haven’t caught up on which items are currently trending? We’ve got you covered! Here’s our guide to the popular and in-demand products that you should start selling on online marketplaces! </p>



<h4>Fitness Gear</h4>



<p>Coming out of lockdown, more and more people have begun prioritizing their health. Items like sportswear, water jugs, and work out equipment are now in heavy demand.</p>



<p>Cater to a physically active crowd by adding these kinds of items to your E-commerce store for the holiday season. </p>



<h4>Video Games and Gaming Accessories  </h4>



<p>From what was once a niche interest, gaming has become more and more mainstream in recent years. Its popularity these days comes as no surprise with the rise of streaming, inspiring more people to get in on the fun.</p>



<p>People are going to be looking for a gift for the gamer in their life, and that’s where your store can come in. Selling products like video games, controllers, and streaming equipment can boost your sales amongst the gamer crowd. </p>



<h4>Kitchenware and Appliances</h4>



<p>Filipinos love cooking, and in recent years, kitchenware has become one the most sought after items in E-commerce. Items that can help make cooking easier are more than welcome in any household, especially with the rising popularity of easy cooking recipes on social media.</p>



<p>Many Filipinos also started food businesses during the pandemic, and those who want to continue growing know that getting good equipment is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>With this in mind, products like air fryers, non-stick pans, and food processors make for great gifts for cooks of all kinds. Merchants should consider selling these, plus other utensils and cookware, on online marketplaces. </p>



<h4>Pet Supplies and Accessories</h4>



<p>Pet owners do not hold back when it comes to keeping their fur babies happy. They’re willing to spend on accessories like scratch posts, treats, and collars without hesitation.</p>



<p>Consider adding pet-friendly items like these to your E-commerce store over the holiday season so you don’t miss out on this opportunity!</p>



<h4>Fashion Items</h4>



<p>Style never goes out of fashion, and Filipinos are some of the most stylish people out there. Clothing like oversized pants, crop tops, and blazers have caught the attention of all kinds of fashionistas, and would be a good addition to any store looking to attract more customers. </p>



<h4>Phone Accessories</h4>



<p>Mobile phones are the gadgets of choice for most Filipinos, with accessories for these devices becoming incredibly popular on online marketplaces. Items like power banks, chargers, and cases are now in high demand, and can be a profitable addition to any merchant’s store. </p>



<p>These are just some of the popular items that you can add to your E-commerce store this holiday season!<br><br>However, even if these products are already in your store, keep in mind that the battle isn’t over yet.

<p>Just a few more days and Christmas will finally be here! While this means a period of merriment and gift-giving, it also means you have just a few more days until the busiest E-commerce season is over. Don’t lose the opportunity to take advantage of it!</p>



<p>If you’re an <a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-services-philippines/"><strong>E-commerce service in the Philippines</strong></a>, you probably already have marketing campaigns in place. Still, it can be helpful to see how else you can boost your sales in the coming days. With that, here are our top holiday tips to make the most of the Christmas rush!</p>



<h4>Create last-minute promos</h4>



<p>While there are some shoppers who do tick off their Christmas lists in advance, some don’t have the time to buy gifts until the very last minute. That’s why one of our holiday tips is to create last-minute promos for these customers.</p>



<p>You can hold a flash sale on specific days of the month (e.g. 10 days before Christmas, or on Christmas day itself), or you can even have creative gift bundles up for the whole month of December! Don’t feel discouraged about creating promos because you feel you’re late to the game.</p>



<h4>Plan some email campaigns</h4>



<p>Email campaigns are a great way to talk directly to customers, especially those who have already bought products from your store. Make email campaigns exciting by offering exclusive discount codes, or early access to website sales. This way, customers will be excited for your holiday campaigns, and will be more likely to patronize your store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to also feature engaging images of your products, and focus more on being visual-heavy when it comes to these types of campaigns &#8212; something similar to a virtual gift catalog. </p>



<h4>Put importance on personalization </h4>



<p>Most purchases around the holidays are for gift-giving, and one seemingly small thing that customers look for is personalization. Offering simple gift-wrapping or holiday note cards can help them save time and resources. It’s also one less thing to worry about for them, as your products will be ready to give once it gets to their homes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is one of the holiday tips you can do for free or for a minimal fee. Either way your customers will appreciate that you’re helping them with holiday preparations.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Amp up digital campaigns </h4>



<p>With today’s digital age, it’s easier than ever to reach out to hundreds or even thousands of people. That’s why it’s the perfect time to amp up your digital marketing campaigns, especially on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invest in marketplace banner ads, social media ads, and even sponsored articles. Do as much as you can to get your product bundles and discounts out there, and it’s sure to catch the attention of potential customers during the Christmas rush.</p>



<h4>Take advantage of post-holiday shopping</h4>



<p>The holiday spirit goes beyond December 25, so don’t be afraid to extend your holiday offerings! Some customers might still need additional gifts, or may want to treat themselves in preparation for the new year. </p>



<p>Having said this, it’s important to cater to these customers by planning out campaigns even until January. After all, the Philippines is known to have one of the longest Christmas seasons!</p>



<ol start="6"></ol>



<h4>Offer same-day delivery</h4>



<p>If there’s anything that last-minute Christmas shoppers need, it’s same-day delivery. We consider this one of the most important holiday tips for the Christmas rush. That’s because offering same-day delivery caters to a specific type of customer &#8212; the one that&#8217;s in a race against time to deliver their gifts. By being a store that can address this need, you have better chances of attracting more customers. </p>



<p>These are just some of the tips that merchants can follow to increase their holiday sales in the next month or two. But if you want to be a reliable and credible E-commerce service in the Philippines, you have to optimize all the aspects of your business – not just ones involving your marketing and sales strategies. To do that, you need a partner in E-commerce who can take care of the legwork, and Payo is the perfect choice for this!</p>



<p>Payo takes care of all the logistical aspects of your business, from <a href="https://payo.asia/warehousing-service-philippines/"><strong>Warehousing</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://payo.asia/fulfillment-service-philippines/">Fulfillment</a> </strong>to <a href="https://payo.asia/last-mile-management/"><strong>Last Mile Management</strong></a>.

<p>Taking these off your plate helps you focus on the bigger picture, ultimately helping you scale your business while having better processes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study">Hubspot</a> study revealed that 93% of customers are more inclined to repeat purchases with companies who offer excellent E-commerce customer service. This only tells us one thing, customer service is essential, no matter how big or small your E-commerce business is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there’s no cookie-cutter approach to customer service, there are ways you can delight your customers and build lifelong relationships that will help your company thrive. Ready to take your E-commerce service in the Philippines to the next level? Start by implementing these customer service best practices.</p>



<h4>Being proactive is key</h4>



<p>Stand out from the competition by having a proactive approach to customer service. For example, ensure that your customer is informed of their package’s whereabouts. And if there is a delay, make sure that you reach out to them as soon as possible. Your customer will appreciate your effort and remember your store the next time they go online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Consistency is the name of the game</h4>



<p>Customers who choose to shop online expect fast reactions and prompt answers. It’s not enough to have a multi-channel approach; you have to make sure that you balance speed and convenience even in customer service. To do so, you have to serve your customers with a consistent level of quality in a short period of time across different channels.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Show that you really care for your customers</h4>



<p>Offering your customers genuine empathy is what can set your business apart. When you add empathy to your strategy, even a simple interaction between you and your customer can be meaningful and memorable. Remember that being approachable helps create great customer experiences that can drive loyalty, positive feedback, and eventually, repeat sales.</p>



<h4>Add a personal touch</h4>



<p>Giving every customer a personalized shopping experience can be challenging. Thankfully, there are small ways in which you can do this! Personalization can be in the form of after-sale follow-ups or small thoughtful gestures like adding free stickers in your packaging. You can also send personalized cards and notes to your customer. By doing any of these, you can deliver excellent customer service in your own simple way.</p>



<h4>Always ask for feedback and act on them</h4>



<p>In the Philippines, E-commerce services taking customer reviews and feedback seriously is a must. If you notice that a customer has had a negative experience with your store, don’t let them feel like they are shouting into a void. Reach out to them, offer a solution, and let them know you value their feedback. Your harshest critics today can be your biggest supporters tomorrow, so don’t forget to engage with feedback or reviews.</p>



<h4>Meet your customers on the channels they prefer</h4>



<p>Online shoppers expect that they can connect with their favorite brands via different channels. The best way to go about this? Meet them on the channels they prefer. Whether it be over social media, email, real-time messaging, offline support channels, or phone calls, communicating with them at their convenience is important. This is also why having a multi-channel presence can prove to be an advantage for your business.</p>



<h4>Measure, optimize, repeat</h4>



<p>One way to know if your E-commerce customer service is working is to set KPIs and track metrics. You can also analyze your performance through generated reports. There are various tools to help you with this. You can start with tracking the number of tickets, chat response rate, and period of resolution of requests. This way, you’ll know exactly where you are in your customer service approach and improve your quality of work.</p>



<h4>Automate your processes with customer service tools</h4>



<p>E-commerce enablers know that automation is the key to efficient processes. Luckily, even customer service in E-commerce can now be automated. There are various software or even help desks you can utilize to help your team connect with customers and organize their information. And with automation, you can resolve issues in as few steps as possible compared to manual processing.</p>



<p>These are just some of the best practices on how you can improve your customer service. Following these best practices can help set your E-commerce service in the Philippines apart from other online stores, so make sure you keep them in mind.</p>



<p>If you are finding it hard to handle customer service on your own, there are E-commerce enablers like Payo that can help you provide excellent customer service.</p>

<p><a href="https://payo.asia/ecommerce-philippines/"><strong>E-commerce in the Philippines</strong></a> continues to grow as many consumers and businesses discover the convenience it offers. With just a few simple taps and clicks, a merchant can set up their shop and start selling, while consumers can make purchases from the comfort of their own homes.</p>



<p>One form of E-commerce that has gained popularity among Filipinos is social selling or selling on social media. Simply put, this refers to the selling of goods through social media platforms. These include sites like Facebook, Instagram, and even TikTok, which has been growing in this capacity as well.</p>



<p>For sellers and merchants who are new to social media selling or are looking for ways to elevate their game, here are six tips that will help secure sales on these platforms.</p>



<h4>Visuals and descriptions matter</h4>



<p>Social media selling means merchants need to place themselves in the shoes of their customers. From having the best product photos that highlight quality, to snappy captions and succinct product descriptions, these details matter to consumers. This is especially true considering they will only be able to view offerings through their desktops or phones.</p>



<h4>Create bundles and promos</h4>



<p>Similar to brick and mortar stores, bundles and promos are a great way to get customers shopping via E-commerce in the Philippines. Merchants can also be creative in their social media selling by making special offers. Additionally, it helps if these promos are exclusive to a specific platform, such as Instagram or Facebook. This also comes in handy when there are holidays and occasions that help customers buy more for less, with merchants getting more sales. </p>



<h4>Prompt responses to inquiries and feedback</h4>



<p>Part of using social media for online selling is being prompt when responding to customer inquiries, feedback, and concerns. While consumers have a growing preference for E-commerce in the Philippines, they also want to be in touch with someone who can answer their questions before they make a purchase. Merchants must constantly check their inbox and the comments section of their posts and be ready to respond or provide further assistance.</p>



<h4>Share positive customer feedback</h4>



<p>Unlike online marketplaces or a website, reviews from social media selling can be scattered throughout the platform. They are sent through messages, on shared posts, or in the comments. Merchants must keep tabs on customer reviews and compile them in an album for others to refer to. This serves as proof of customers being satisfied with the store’s service.</p>



<h4>Stay active and be creative</h4>



<p>Since this is social media, selling on these platforms will require merchants to post updates regularly to stay on their customers&#8217; digital feed. This can be through static posts, videos, stories and other means to upload product-related content. If there are no new announcements, merchants can get creative. They can rework product photos, make short videos, or recreate viral trends that can be picked up by the platform’s algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To add to this, merchants can also host live selling sessions on their chosen platform. They can offer live-exclusive deals, giveaways, and other bundles to keep customers tuned in all throughout.</p>



<h4>Explore ads and boosted posts</h4>



<p>If there’s an available budget, social media selling also offers ways to promote products through ads and boosted or sponsored posts. By targeting a specific audience, these posts can reach potential customers and draw both traffic and interest to a merchant’s E-commerce shop in the Philippines.</p>
