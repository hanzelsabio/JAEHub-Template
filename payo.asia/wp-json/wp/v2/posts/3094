While this means a period of merriment and gift-giving, it also means you have just a few more days until the busiest E-commerce season is over. Don\u2019t lose the opportunity to take advantage of it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re an <a href=\"https:\/\/payo.asia\/ecommerce-services-philippines\/\"><strong>E-commerce service in the Philippines<\/strong><\/a>, you probably already have marketing campaigns in place. Still, it can be helpful to see how else you can boost your sales in the coming days. With that, here are our top holiday tips to make the most of the Christmas rush!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Create last-minute promos<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are some shoppers who do tick off their Christmas lists in advance, some don\u2019t have the time to buy gifts until the very last minute. That\u2019s why one of our holiday tips is to create last-minute promos for these customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hold a flash sale on specific days of the month (e.g. 10 days before Christmas, or on Christmas day itself), or you can even have creative gift bundles up for the whole month of December! Don\u2019t feel discouraged about creating promos because you feel you\u2019re late to the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Plan some email campaigns<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Email campaigns are a great way to talk directly to customers, especially those who have already bought products from your store. Make email campaigns exciting by offering exclusive discount codes, or early access to website sales. This way, customers will be excited for your holiday campaigns, and will be more likely to patronize your store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to also feature engaging images of your products, and focus more on being visual-heavy when it comes to these types of campaigns &#8212; something similar to a virtual gift catalog.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Put importance on personalization\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most purchases around the holidays are for gift-giving, and one seemingly small thing that customers look for is personalization. Offering simple gift-wrapping or holiday note cards can help them save time and resources. It\u2019s also one less thing to worry about for them, as your products will be ready to give once it gets to their homes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the holiday tips you can do for free or for a minimal fee. Either way your customers will appreciate that you\u2019re helping them with holiday preparations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Amp up digital campaigns\u00a0<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With today\u2019s digital age, it\u2019s easier than ever to reach out to hundreds or even thousands of people. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the perfect time to amp up your digital marketing campaigns, especially on social media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invest in marketplace banner ads, social media ads, and even sponsored articles. Do as much as you can to get your product bundles and discounts out there, and it\u2019s sure to catch the attention of potential customers during the Christmas rush.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Take advantage of post-holiday shopping<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The holiday spirit goes beyond December 25, so don\u2019t be afraid to extend your holiday offerings! Some customers might still need additional gifts, or may want to treat themselves in preparation for the new year.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said this, it\u2019s important to cater to these customers by planning out campaigns even until January. After all, the Philippines is known to have one of the longest Christmas seasons!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>Offer same-day delivery<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\u2019s anything that last-minute Christmas shoppers need, it\u2019s same-day delivery. We consider this one of the most important holiday tips for the Christmas rush. That\u2019s because offering same-day delivery caters to a specific type of customer &#8212; the one that&#8217;s in a race against time to deliver their gifts. By being a store that can address this need, you have better chances of attracting more customers.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just some of the tips that merchants can follow to increase their holiday sales in the next month or two. But if you want to be a reliable and credible E-commerce service in the Philippines, you have to optimize all the aspects of your business \u2013 not just ones involving your marketing and sales strategies.
